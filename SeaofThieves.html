        <h1> Sea of Thieves</h1>
        <p> Sea of thieves is an open world pirate game full of PvE and PvP. I at
          the time of writing this have play around 200hrs so I believe I have learned
          alot about the game and the sort of dark sides of the game.</p>

        <p>In sea of thieves there is really no progession which I like, it isnt a game
          where you will get stronger cannons or armor protected ships. Meaning there
          are different sized ships, but for example no sloop will be different than another sloop
          other than cosmetic based differences. I really like this concept because it makes
          any sort of PvP interaction come based to the mechanics of the game, and who spent
          the most time stocking up their ships with cannons and supplies. The whole point
        of the game is to run emissary quest(which I will discuss emissaries later) or
        world events to get treasure, you then sell that treasure to recieve gold, and
      you use that gold to buy cosmetics. Most cosmetics however will have a requirements
    such as kill different pirate lords until you are able to purchase that cosmetic item.</p>

    <p>Their are 5 emisarries that you can run in Sea of Thieves, Gold Horder (gold), Order
      of Souls(skulls), Merchant Alliance(merchant items), Reaper(PvP), and Athena(athena items).
      With each emissary you have emissary quest that you run to raise your emissary value.
      In a single session if you gather enough emissary items, you can raise your emissary flag
      value, and you can sell items for a larger profit. Each month their is also a emissary
      ledger where the top sellers get certain cosmetics for that emissary. The Reaper
      emissary doesnt have specific quest to raise emissary value so you have to do world event
      or PvP in order to raise your emissary value. The Athena emissary is really hard to
      level up because the items are so rare as well as you have to be a pirate legend (level 50
      in 3 emissaries) in order to buy quest in this emissary.

        <p>First thing I want to say is that this is a really fun game to play with
          multiple people or your friends, this can be a very hard game especially to newer players
          when you play buy yourself because it is an open sea game with 5-6 ships and
          16 players max in any Sea of Thieves lobby. Meaning as a solo sloop(1-2 player ship)
          it is possible to run into a Galleon(3-4 player ship) of very skilled player where
          you almost have 2 options, run forever, or just let them sink you. Also as a solo
        sloop, some world events seem nearly impossible such as the fort of fortunes because
      the AI is really good at shooting cannons as you pull up to the fort so you can sink then,
    plus all the waves of skeletons,the 2 mini-bosses, then the pirate lord, it can easily take
  an hour and a half for players like me who have 200 hrs, and during that time it is very easy
for another player ship to roll up and easily sink you before you even notice them.Also if you die
whent fighting a pirate lord, while you are respawning which takes around 30 sec, the pirate
lord will throw large fireballs at your ship so you have to repair your ship, while youre repairing your
ship, the pirate lord will still throw fireballs which can kill you again and you can easily sink. With that
being said, Rare has made it easier for smalled ships to complete world events, but they are still difficult.

<p> I really enjoy this game even as a solo sloop I sometime can have fun, but in the
  current state of the game, ive noticed everybody is super PvP hungry, not even necesarilly for
    loot, but just for the fun of it which I can relate, just the other day I was on a brig and we fought
    a level 4 reaper for an hour, both ship had an amazing time and we all said our GGs. However,
    there have been times where i've been trying to do grindy things such as tall tales, or just gathering books.
    Sometimes in these times, a random ship(never another solo player) will roll up on
    me and instantly sink me, even when I tell them what im doing and that I have nothing.
    A majority of the time you dont lose much, but it is a bit annoying. I would completely
    understand them sinking me if I had anything of value, but I have nothing.</p>

  <p> All in all, if you have alot of time to play and have other people you can play
    with, I think Sea of Thieves can be a really fun and rewarding game, just dont be salty
    if you get sunk with a bunch of loot, it is going to happen and its something you
    have to get used to. However if you want to play as a solo sloop, be prepared for bigger
    ships to attack you unprovoked and maybe stay away from some world events. The easiest world event
    for a solo player would probably be the Ashen Winds, but even still if you die, your ship is completely
    unprotected. At the bottom of the page will be some helpful links if you are more interested in
    the pirates life. There is also another reputation called Hunters call which I havent
    really worked on, it mainly has to do with fishing which is a bit boring. However, I have
    made a small table that may help you if you are interested in Hunter's Call.
    I appreciate anybody who has read this and hopefully I will see you on the seas.</p>

      <h1> Counter Strike: Global Offensive </h1>
      <p> Counterstrike Global Offensive is a game that I started playing in 2015.
        Since then I have put just over 3000 hrs into the game yet I am still one
        of the lowest ranks in the game. I really enjoy this game but they saying once
        you are in silver, you will always be in silver seems to be really true in my case.
        With that being said if i really hated the game i wouldnt have put 3k hours into it.</p>

        <p>Before i go on a tangent about CSGO, to the people who have never heard of this game,
        Counterstrike originally was named Counterstrike Source or some people may
        call it CS 1.6, which is the base game of Counterstrike. Then back in 2012,
        Valve released a more updated Game called CounterStrike Global Offensive which is what
        everybody plays now. The general idea of Counterstrike is very simple, a 5v5 multiplayer
        competitive shooter in where the T sides objective is to plants the bomb and the CT sides
        objective is to stop the T side from planting the bomb or defusing the bomb. Their
        are other different game modes but for the sake of this review i only want to talk about the
        Classic Competitive which is what i just described.</p>

        <p> I personally love this game so much because its a fun game to queue up With
          friends and play a couple games, they even recently added short mode which is only
          max 15 rounds vs the classic 30 rounds which can be really awful if you are playing
          against a good team. Depending on your rank which defines your skill group, you can really
          thrive up into the Gold Novas just with good aim and game mechanics, but you do reach
          a point where everybody has good aim and mechanics so you will really need to understand
          the rotations and skills of other players to thrive up into higher ranks.</p>

          <p>My biggest issue with the game at the moment is the ranking system. I dont believe
            the ranking system is accurate, not to mention cheaters and what we call smurfs which are people
            who create new accounts to play in lower ranks when they are really higher ranks. I
            understand i am not a pro player but i do have 3000 hrs in the game, decent aim, fairly good knowledge
            of everything in the game, yet im still stuck in silver. There are times where
            i have gotten into the Gold Novas only to fall back down to silver due to in my opinion
            bad players on my team and near pro players on the enemy, but they are also my rank.
            In my opinion, their is not a large skill gap between Silver Elite Master and Gold Nova 3.
            As i have played many games in both ranks and all between, they all feel the same. In my opinion
            Valve could very easily fix this just like Valorant does and reset ranks every couple of
            months so players like me will have a chance to get into the higher ranks where they
            deserve to be.</p>

      <p>I personally Dont believe this game would have survived very long and kept as
        many players as they have today if it wasnt for the skin market. CSGO isnt all
        about the pro scene and really even the meta of the game, everything revolves around
        the skin market. To people who dont understand, when i say skins, im refering to gun skins
        that you can unbox (gambling) or straight up buy off the steam market or through a
        3rd party website like CSMoney or Skinport. To people who dont understand
        these skins can range in the price of 3 cents to millions of dollars and they almost
        act as a stock market, skins and the cases you unbox can fluctuate in price based on supply and demand.
        I personally love Skins and have around a $1200 inventory that i have collected over the years.
        However i do not recommend gambling or unboxing a lot of cases to get cool and expensive skins,
        you are just better off saving up that money and right out purchasing the skin which is
        what i have been doing for around the past year.<p>

        <p> To conclude my review, i want everyone to know that you can have a really fun time playing
          CSGO, but as a new player you have to have thick skin because other players can
          be ruthless. The other thing you need to not worry about is your rank, after many years
          and still being Silver, i have sort of given up on my rank and i just play to enjoy myself
          and to have fun with friends. However if you do care about ranking, their is a 3rd party
          matchmaking service called FaceIt, its free and has way better matchmaking for
          competitive games. Lastly if you think you are going to unbox cases and get a million dollar
          knife, think again, save up your money and buy whatever skin you are looking for. Thank you all
          for reading this far and have a good day. </p>

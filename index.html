      <h1>WELCOME!</h1>
      <p>Hello Everybody and welcome to my first website I have personally coded
        by myself with the help of the best Professor Sean Burns. For the moment this
        website will be dedicated to my multiple and expanding game reviews posts.
      </p>

        <p>I started out gaming back in middle school on my PS3 playing Call of Duty, then during my
          freshman year in high school i switched to PC gaming. At The time I strictly played minecraft and
      did not play a wide variety of games like i do now. That quickly took a turn when i
      graduated high school and build my first computer in May of 2018. Nowadays I play anything
      from MMOs such as the newly released Lost Ark and team based shooter games such as Counterstrike: Global
    Offensive.</p>

    <p>Sooner or later i wish to add a section for you all to give me suggestions on what games
    you all would be interested in me playing and reviewing.</p>
